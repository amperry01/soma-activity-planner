# Sōma: Personalized Activity Planner

An AI-powered wellness app that uses Oura health data to **predict recovery needs** and **recommend optimal activity timing**.  
The system integrates **time series modeling**, **personalized classification**, and a clean, responsive frontend to help users align their activities with their body’s readiness.

## Features
- **Data Integration:** Reads and processes Oura Ring data
- **Time Series Modeling:** Forecasts recovery and readiness trends
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Classifies optimal activity windows
- **Fullstack Implementation:** RESTful API backend + responsive frontend

## Planned Tech Stack
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI/Flask, scikit-learn/PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy  
**Frontend:** React (MUI) or Next.js, Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap  
**Data:** Oura API / exported data files  
**Deployment:** Vercel/Render

## Project Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate sample Oura data (mock dataset for dev)  
- [ ] Build data preprocessing pipeline  
- [ ] Develop ML model for activity recommendation  
- [ ] Create REST API endpoints  
- [ ] Build frontend UI for recommendations  
- [ ] Deploy MVP  

## Example (Planned)
Visuals will be added after the first MVP build, including activity recommendation timelines and recovery forecasts.
